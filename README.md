# Classification-Decision-Tree-Algorithm-
Decision Tree Algorithm # Prediction of the possibility of diabetes # based on some features
Importing libraries and data set
creat our model based on DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3), resulting in Accuracy: 0.7575757575757576
we drwed some plot including: 
Output of decision tree in Text format which shows boundries and classes. 
Then output of decision tree in tree plot format
